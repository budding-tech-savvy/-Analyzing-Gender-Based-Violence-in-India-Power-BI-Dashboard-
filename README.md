# -Analyzing-Gender-Based-Violence-in-India-Power-BI-Dashboard-
I’m excited to share my latest project, a Power BI dashboard that sheds light on the crimes committed against women across various states in India. The goal of this project is to visually represent important data, helping others better understand the trends and challenges women face regarding safety and justice.

What This Dashboard Offers:
The dashboard is built around a variety of key indicators that track different types of crimes against women over time. These include:

Rape Cases
Domestic Violence
Cases Against Women’s Modesty
Assault Cases
Women Trafficking
Dowry Deaths
Each type of crime has been represented through dedicated pages, showing trends and patterns over the years, with insights into specific states in India. Using graphs and charts, I aim to help users quickly grasp the seriousness and spread of these issues.

Why I Built This:
This dashboard is more than just data points—it’s a way to help spread awareness about the safety of women in India. By visualizing this data, I hope to foster greater understanding of where and how these crimes occur, helping policymakers, activists, and everyday citizens make more informed decisions.

How It Works:
Using Power BI, I’ve analyzed data across multiple years and states. I’ve also applied advanced formulas known as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create dynamic and accurate trends. These formulas help break down complex datasets and turn them into easy-to-read visuals, showing:

Year-over-year changes in crime rates
State-by-state comparisons
Long-term trends to highlight improvements or worsening conditions
Key Features:
Interactive Pages: Users can explore individual types of crime, with each page focused on a specific crime (like domestic violence or dowry deaths).
Trends and Patterns: The dashboard makes it easy to see whether certain crimes have increased or decreased over the years.
Statewise Insights: Compare data across Indian states to identify regional trends.
Why This Matters:
Visualizing crime data is an essential step toward addressing and solving these issues. With this dashboard, I aim to contribute to the conversation around women’s safety in India, empowering others with insights that can drive action.
